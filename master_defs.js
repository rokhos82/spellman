As soon as the spirit is stolen, the body becomes lifeless, but biological functions still continue and it can survive if nourished with food and water.

The caster must make two casting checks and spends strain for both castings. An opposed resistance test between the caster and each target must be made (each person rolls only once). If the caster\'s SPIRIT test result is greater than both of the victims, the two target\'s have their souls switched to the other\'s body. Casting the spell in this manner costs the caster 2 Karma.</p> <p><i>Possession</i>: The caster can cast the spell as described in Mind/Body Switch except instead of switching two souls, he inserts his own into the victim\'s body, leaving his own behind (requiring two simultaneous castings of the spell, as described in Mind/Body Switch). Once a body is possessed, the caster and victim must make an opposed resistance check whenever they want to take control of the body. Attempting to take control of the body costs 5 STAM to the individual attempting to take control. Once one or the other takes control, the other entity can not attempt to take control for 1d10 minutes. Both the caster and the victim retain their own SPIRIT, WILL, REA, STAM values, and mental skills. Both spirits share access to the new body\'s physical skills and attributes and can call upon them at any time, although the value for the caster\'s own physical skills is 1/2 what they were in his own body. This version of the spell costs 2 Karma to cast.</p> <p><i>Personal Stasis</i>: casters can cast this spell upon themselves in order put themselves into a stasis or move their spirit to a new body as described in Trap the Soul.
