spellman
========

SpellMan gives a caster a digital spell book to keep track of disciplines and spells.  There is also a portion for use during game play to track stmaina usage and active spells.

I haven't touched this project in almost two years and there is a lot of refactory that needs to be done.  The app mostly works right now; however, most spells do not have completed definitions yet so the calculator functionality is hit and miss.

Todo
========
* Clean up UI code
* Convert spell defitions to a database rather than js file
* Convert existing spell calcuation objects to JavaScript for ease of use
* Flesh out character details
